	A <strong>Matrix</strong> field allows you to create a series of sequential ‘blocks’
	that represent different content types. Each content type contains its own fields.
	The CMS leverages this functionality to allow the user to build up a set of content
	using these blocks.
</p>

<p>
	To explain the benefits of using matrix fields, we'll first illustrate where
	other CMS’s fall down:
</p>

<p>
	When adding a page, most CMS’s offer a single large field (often referred to
	as a WYSIWYG editor) where all the content for that page is added. There are
	usually buttons to alter text formatting and sizes, to insert images,
	videos, tables, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Whilst it may seem more convenient from a user’s point of view to add all
	this content into one field, from a web developer’s point of view it is an
	absolute nightmare! Giving the user this much control over
	spacing/formatting almost invariably leads to content that looks messy and
	off-brand with the rest of the website.
</p>

<p>
	Matrix fields help to eradicate this problem by breaking each type of
	content into its own ‘block’.
</p>

<p>
	When you click on one of the available content type options, a block appears
	containing the relevant fields for that content type.
</p>

<p>
	For example if I click on the Image type within the Rich Content matrix
	field, a block appears containing the following fields:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Image (an asset field)</li>
	<li>
		Image Caption (plain text field, add a caption to display underneath the
		image)
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Further blocks can be added by clicking the relevant content type buttons.
	In this way, the user builds up a set of content for the entry organised
	into convenient chunks, which already have the correct styles defined for
	them.
</p>

<p>
	Blocks can be dragged into new positions by clicking on the ‘4 dots’ icon at
	the top right of the block.
</p>

<p>
	Blocks can also be disabled or deleted by clicking the ‘cog’ icon at the top
	right on the block.
</p>
