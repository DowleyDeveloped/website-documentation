	The Assets area of the control panel is where you’ll find any uploaded images, documents etc. It’s essentially a repository for all files that have been uploaded elsewhere in the control panel.
</p>

<p>
	Assets can be uploaded directly from this area, but in general you’ll be uploading images/documents as and when you’re adding/editing entries. When you add an image/document to an entry, it will automatically appear in the relevant group in the Assets section.
</p>

<p>
	There are also various other actions that you can use in the Assets section. If you check the box next to a specific asset and then click the ‘cog’ menu below the list, you will see a list of actions you can apply to that asset (see below).
